# Electricity-Consumption-LSTM

The goal is to use a recurrent neural network that must learn to predict a the electricity consumption of households in Poland. 

We first define a window size and then use LSTMS to model our system

We further test out our model by changing the hyperparameters-
batch_size
num_epochs
train_val_ratio

We later deal with overfitting using the following methods-
Weight decay
Early Stopping
